# PostgreSQL Metrics Dashboard - Project Plan

## Overview
Build a full-stack web application that connects to a local PostgreSQL database, automatically discovers and analyzes tables, and generates an interactive dashboard with intelligent visualizations.

---

## Phase 1: Database Connection & Schema Introspection ✅
- [x] Install required dependencies (psycopg2-binary for PostgreSQL)
- [x] Create database connection module with connection pooling
- [x] Implement schema introspection to discover tables and columns
- [x] Build data type detection logic (timestamps, numerics, categoricals)
- [x] Create state management for database metadata
- [x] Test connection and schema parsing with sample queries

---

## Phase 2: Backend API & Data Query Engine ✅
- [x] Build query engine for fetching table data with filters
- [x] Implement time range filtering for timestamp columns
- [x] Create aggregation logic for KPIs and statistics
- [x] Add categorical grouping for bar/pie chart data
- [x] Implement efficient query caching mechanism
- [x] Create event handlers for data fetching and filtering

---

## Phase 3: Frontend Dashboard UI with Dynamic Visualizations ✅
- [x] Design responsive dashboard layout (header, sidebar, main content grid)
- [x] Build table/metric selection controls with dropdowns
- [x] Implement time range picker component
- [x] Create KPI stat cards for aggregated metrics
- [x] Build dynamic chart rendering (line charts for time series)
- [x] Add bar charts for categorical breakdowns
- [x] Implement chart switching and configuration options
- [x] Style with modern design system (consistent spacing, typography, colors)
- [x] Fix table selection bug (empty state handling in data table)
- [x] Add proper value conversion for pandas data types

---

## Phase 4: Intelligence Layer & Auto-Visualization ✅
- [x] Build heuristic engine to classify column types
- [x] Implement auto-visualization logic (time series → line, categorical → bar)
- [x] Create default dashboard configuration on startup
- [x] Add smart metric detection (find `temperature`, `value`, `count` columns)
- [x] Implement automatic chart type selection
- [x] Build visualization recommendation system
- [x] Add KPI card components with aggregation support
- [x] Create chart components for line and bar charts
- [x] Add filter controls for metrics and visualization types

---

## Phase 5: Interactive Features & Polish
- [ ] Add real-time chart updates when filters change
- [ ] Implement chart legends and tooltips
- [ ] Create export functionality (CSV, JSON)
- [ ] Add loading states and error handling for charts
- [ ] Implement responsive design for mobile/tablet
- [ ] Add dark mode toggle
- [ ] Create user preferences persistence

---

## Phase 6: Performance & Documentation
- [ ] Optimize database queries with indexing suggestions
- [ ] Implement query result caching
- [ ] Add pagination for large datasets
- [ ] Create comprehensive README with setup instructions
- [ ] Add inline code documentation
- [ ] Include example database schema and seed data
- [ ] Write deployment guide

---

## Current Status
✅ Completed Phases 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Phase 4 Deliverables:**
- Heuristic engine for automatic column type classification
- Auto-visualization logic that recommends chart types based on data
- Smart metric detection for numeric columns
- KPI card components showing aggregations (sum, avg, min, max, count)
- Line chart component for time series visualization
- Bar chart component for categorical breakdowns
- Filter controls for selecting metrics and chart types
- Automatic chart generation on table selection
- Visualization state management with chart configuration

**Key Features Added:**
- Automatic detection of time series, numeric, and categorical columns
- Smart chart recommendations (line for time series, bar for categorical)
- KPI cards with real-time aggregations
- Dynamic chart rendering based on data types
- Filter dropdowns for metric selection
- Chart type switching
- Clean grid layout for visualizations

## Notes
- Using psycopg2-binary for PostgreSQL connectivity
- Reflex framework for unified Python frontend/backend
- Pandas for efficient data manipulation and aggregation
- Environment variable: DATABASE_URL for connection string
- Database connection includes proper error handling and timeouts
- UI includes comprehensive loading and error states
- Auto-visualization uses column name patterns and data types for intelligent chart selection
- KPI aggregations calculated server-side for performance
