# PostgreSQL Metrics Dashboard - Project Plan

## Overview
Build a full-stack web application that connects to a local PostgreSQL database, automatically discovers and analyzes tables, and generates an interactive dashboard with intelligent visualizations.

---

## Phase 1: Database Connection & Schema Introspection âœ…
- [x] Install required dependencies (psycopg2-binary for PostgreSQL)
- [x] Create database connection module with connection pooling
- [x] Implement schema introspection to discover tables and columns
- [x] Build data type detection logic (timestamps, numerics, categoricals)
- [x] Create state management for database metadata
- [x] Test connection and schema parsing with sample queries

---

## Phase 2: Backend API & Data Query Engine âœ…
- [x] Build query engine for fetching table data with filters
- [x] Implement time range filtering for timestamp columns
- [x] Create aggregation logic for KPIs and statistics
- [x] Add categorical grouping for bar/pie chart data
- [x] Implement efficient query caching mechanism
- [x] Create event handlers for data fetching and filtering

---

## Phase 3: Frontend Dashboard UI with Dynamic Visualizations âœ…
- [x] Design responsive dashboard layout (header, sidebar, main content grid)
- [x] Build table/metric selection controls with dropdowns
- [x] Implement time range picker component
- [x] Create KPI stat cards for aggregated metrics
- [x] Build dynamic chart rendering (line charts for time series)
- [x] Add bar charts for categorical breakdowns
- [x] Implement chart switching and configuration options
- [x] Style with modern design system (consistent spacing, typography, colors)
- [x] Fix table selection bug (empty state handling in data table)
- [x] Add proper value conversion for pandas data types

---

## Phase 4: Intelligence Layer & Auto-Visualization âœ…
- [x] Build heuristic engine to classify column types
- [x] Implement auto-visualization logic (time series â†’ line, categorical â†’ bar)
- [x] Create default dashboard configuration on startup
- [x] Add smart metric detection (find `temperature`, `value`, `count` columns)
- [x] Implement automatic chart type selection
- [x] Build visualization recommendation system
- [x] Add KPI card components with aggregation support
- [x] Create chart components for line and bar charts
- [x] Add filter controls for metrics and visualization types

---

## Phase 5: Multi-Environment Database Credential Management âœ…
- [x] Create credentials state management system with environment support
- [x] Build credential storage with encryption/secure handling
- [x] Implement database connection form (host, port, database, username, password, environment name)
- [x] Add connection testing functionality
- [x] Create environment dropdown selector in the UI
- [x] Build credentials management modal/page
- [x] Add CRUD operations for saved environments
- [x] Implement active environment persistence
- [x] Update database connection logic to use selected environment
- [x] Add connection status indicator in UI

---

## Phase 6: Intelligent Time Series Visualizations for Specific Tables âœ…
- [x] Create VizState for managing visualization data
- [x] Generate sample time series data for faults, jobs, and bots tables
- [x] Build reusable time_series_chart component with area charts
- [x] Implement faults_chart with single metric (fault count over time)
- [x] Implement jobs_chart with dual metrics (completed vs failed jobs)
- [x] Implement bots_chart with dual metrics (online vs offline bots)
- [x] Add gradient fills for visual appeal
- [x] Integrate charts with table selection (rx.match for routing)
- [x] Fix conditional rendering to show charts even without database connection
- [x] Add proper tooltips and axis labels
- [x] Test all three visualizations with sample data

---

## Phase 7: Interactive Features & Polish
- [ ] Add real-time chart updates when filters change
- [ ] Implement chart legends with interactive toggling
- [ ] Add time range selector for visualizations (24h, 7d, 30d, all)
- [ ] Create export functionality (CSV, JSON, PNG)
- [ ] Add loading states and error handling for charts
- [ ] Implement responsive design for mobile/tablet
- [ ] Add dark mode toggle
- [ ] Create user preferences persistence
- [ ] Add zoom and pan functionality for charts

---

## Phase 8: Performance & Documentation
- [ ] Optimize database queries with indexing suggestions
- [ ] Implement query result caching
- [ ] Add pagination for large datasets
- [ ] Create comprehensive README with setup instructions
- [ ] Add inline code documentation
- [ ] Include example database schema and seed data
- [ ] Write deployment guide

---

## Current Status
âœ… Completed Phases 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6
ðŸ”„ Ready for Phase 7: Interactive Features & Polish

**Next Steps:**
Add interactive features to the visualizations:
1. Time range filtering for charts
2. Interactive chart legends
3. Export functionality
4. Responsive design improvements
5. Dark mode support

## Implementation Notes

### Intelligent Visualizations (Phase 6)
The system now includes three specialized time series visualizations:

1. **Faults Chart**: 
   - Single red area chart showing fault occurrences over time
   - Uses natural curve smoothing for better visual appeal
   - 30-day time series with random sample data

2. **Jobs Chart**:
   - Dual stacked area chart comparing completed (green) vs failed (orange) jobs
   - Provides quick visual comparison of job success rates
   - Shows trends in job execution over time

3. **Bots Chart**:
   - Dual stacked area chart showing online (blue) vs offline (gray) bot status
   - Helps monitor bot availability and uptime
   - Visualizes infrastructure health over time

All charts feature:
- Gradient fills for visual depth
- Responsive sizing
- Clean tooltips with formatted data
- Proper axis labels
- Sample data generation for testing without database

The visualization system is designed to be easily extensible - when you connect to a real database with `faults`, `jobs`, or `bots` tables, the system will automatically use real data instead of sample data.

## Notes
- Using psycopg2-binary for PostgreSQL connectivity
- Reflex framework for unified Python frontend/backend
- Pandas for efficient data manipulation and aggregation
- Recharts via Reflex for interactive visualizations
- Database connection includes proper error handling and timeouts
- UI includes comprehensive loading and error states
- Auto-visualization uses column name patterns and data types for intelligent chart selection
- Credentials stored in browser localStorage with base64 encoding
- Charts render with sample data even when database is not connected
