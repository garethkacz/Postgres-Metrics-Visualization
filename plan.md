# PostgreSQL Metrics Dashboard - Project Plan

## Overview
Build a full-stack web application that connects to a local PostgreSQL database, automatically discovers and analyzes tables, and generates an interactive dashboard with intelligent visualizations.

---

## Phase 1: Database Connection & Schema Introspection âœ…
- [x] Install required dependencies (psycopg2-binary for PostgreSQL)
- [x] Create database connection module with connection pooling
- [x] Implement schema introspection to discover tables and columns
- [x] Build data type detection logic (timestamps, numerics, categoricals)
- [x] Create state management for database metadata
- [x] Test connection and schema parsing with sample queries

---

## Phase 2: Backend API & Data Query Engine âœ…
- [x] Build query engine for fetching table data with filters
- [x] Implement time range filtering for timestamp columns
- [x] Create aggregation logic for KPIs and statistics
- [x] Add categorical grouping for bar/pie chart data
- [x] Implement efficient query caching mechanism
- [x] Create event handlers for data fetching and filtering

---

## Phase 3: Frontend Dashboard UI with Dynamic Visualizations âœ…
- [x] Design responsive dashboard layout (header, sidebar, main content grid)
- [x] Build table/metric selection controls with dropdowns
- [x] Implement time range picker component
- [x] Create KPI stat cards for aggregated metrics
- [x] Build dynamic chart rendering (line charts for time series)
- [x] Add bar charts for categorical breakdowns
- [x] Implement chart switching and configuration options
- [x] Style with modern design system (consistent spacing, typography, colors)
- [x] Fix table selection bug (empty state handling in data table)
- [x] Add proper value conversion for pandas data types

---

## Phase 4: Intelligence Layer & Auto-Visualization âœ…
- [x] Build heuristic engine to classify column types
- [x] Implement auto-visualization logic (time series â†’ line, categorical â†’ bar)
- [x] Create default dashboard configuration on startup
- [x] Add smart metric detection (find `temperature`, `value`, `count` columns)
- [x] Implement automatic chart type selection
- [x] Build visualization recommendation system
- [x] Add KPI card components with aggregation support
- [x] Create chart components for line and bar charts
- [x] Add filter controls for metrics and visualization types

---

## Phase 5: Multi-Environment Database Credential Management
- [ ] Create credentials state management system with environment support
- [ ] Build credential storage with encryption/secure handling
- [ ] Implement database connection form (host, port, database, username, password, environment name)
- [ ] Add connection testing functionality
- [ ] Create environment dropdown selector in the UI
- [ ] Build credentials management modal/page
- [ ] Add CRUD operations for saved environments
- [ ] Implement active environment persistence
- [ ] Update database connection logic to use selected environment
- [ ] Add connection status indicator in UI

---

## Phase 6: Interactive Features & Polish
- [ ] Add real-time chart updates when filters change
- [ ] Implement chart legends and tooltips
- [ ] Create export functionality (CSV, JSON)
- [ ] Add loading states and error handling for charts
- [ ] Implement responsive design for mobile/tablet
- [ ] Add dark mode toggle
- [ ] Create user preferences persistence

---

## Phase 7: Performance & Documentation
- [ ] Optimize database queries with indexing suggestions
- [ ] Implement query result caching
- [ ] Add pagination for large datasets
- [ ] Create comprehensive README with setup instructions
- [ ] Add inline code documentation
- [ ] Include example database schema and seed data
- [ ] Write deployment guide

---

## Current Status
âœ… Completed Phases 1, 2, 3, and 4
ðŸ”„ Working on Phase 5: Multi-Environment Database Credential Management

**Next Steps:**
Implement a credential management system that allows users to:
1. Add/edit/delete database connection configurations
2. Store credentials for multiple environments (dev, staging, prod, etc.)
3. Select active environment from a dropdown
4. Test connections before saving
5. Securely persist credentials locally

## Notes
- Using psycopg2-binary for PostgreSQL connectivity
- Reflex framework for unified Python frontend/backend
- Pandas for efficient data manipulation and aggregation
- Environment variable: DATABASE_URL for connection string (will become optional)
- Database connection includes proper error handling and timeouts
- UI includes comprehensive loading and error states
- Auto-visualization uses column name patterns and data types for intelligent chart selection
- KPI aggregations calculated server-side for performance
- Credentials will be stored in local JSON file with base64 encoding for basic obfuscation
