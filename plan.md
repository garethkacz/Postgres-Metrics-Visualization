- [x] Add gradient fills for visual appeal
- [x] Integrate charts with table selection (rx.match for routing)
- [x] Fix conditional rendering to show charts even without database connection
- [x] Add proper tooltips and axis labels
- [x] Test all three visualizations with sample data

---

## Phase 7: SSH Tunnel Support for VPN Database Connections âœ…
- [x] Install sshtunnel library for secure tunneling
- [x] Add SSH tunnel fields to Env model (ssh_host, ssh_port, ssh_user, ssh_key)
- [x] Update credentials form with SSH tunnel configuration section
- [x] Implement SSH tunnel connection logic in DatabaseState._get_db_conn()
- [x] Support SSH key-based authentication (private key as string)
- [x] Handle tunnel lifecycle (establish before DB connect, close after)
- [x] Add comprehensive error handling for tunnel failures
- [x] Test SSH tunnel configuration and connection flow

---

## Phase 8: Interactive Features & Polish

- [ ] Implement query result caching
- [ ] Add pagination for large datasets
- [ ] Create comprehensive README with setup instructions
- [ ] Add inline code documentation
- [ ] Include example database schema and seed data
- [ ] Write deployment guide

## Current Status
âœ… Completed Phases 1-7
ðŸ”„ Ready for Phase 8: Interactive Features & Polish

**Next Steps:**
Add interactive features to the visualizations:
1. Time range filtering for charts
2. Interactive chart legends
3. Export functionality
4. Responsive design improvements
5. Dark mode support

## Implementation Notes

### SSH Tunnel Support (Phase 7)
The application now supports secure connections to PostgreSQL databases behind VPN using SSH tunnels:

**Connection Architecture:**
```
Cloud-Based Reflex App â†’ SSH Tunnel â†’ Jump Host (on VPN) â†’ PostgreSQL Database
```

**Features Implemented:**
1. **SSH Tunnel Configuration**: Added SSH fields to environment credentials (host, port, user, private key)
2. **Automatic Tunnel Management**: Establishes SSH tunnel before database connection when configured
3. **Security**: All database traffic encrypted via SSH, database never exposed to internet
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of VPN disconnects, SSH auth failures, and timeout errors
5. **Key-Based Auth**: Support for SSH private keys stored as strings in browser localStorage

**Setup Instructions:**
1. **Jump Host Setup** (one-time):
   - Ensure jump host is connected to GlobalProtect VPN
   - Jump host must have network access to PostgreSQL database
   - Configure SSH key-based authentication on jump host

2. **Configure Environment**:
   - Database Host: Internal database IP (e.g., 10.0.1.50)
   - Database Port: 5432
   - SSH Host: Jump host IP or hostname
   - SSH Port: 22
   - SSH User: Your SSH username
   - SSH Private Key: Paste full private key content

3. **Connection Flow**:
   - App establishes SSH tunnel to jump host
   - Tunnel forwards local port to database server
   - App connects to database through tunnel
   - All traffic encrypted end-to-end

**Error Handling:**
- VPN/tunnel disconnection â†’ Clear error message, retry logic
- SSH authentication failure â†’ Specific error with troubleshooting steps
- Database unreachable â†’ Connection status indicator, helpful guidance
- Timeout errors â†’ Automatic cleanup and status reporting

### Intelligent Visualizations (Phase 6)
The system includes three specialized time series visualizations:

1. **Faults Chart**: Single red area chart showing fault occurrences over time
2. **Jobs Chart**: Dual stacked area chart comparing completed vs failed jobs
3. **Bots Chart**: Dual stacked area chart showing online vs offline bot status

All charts feature gradient fills, responsive sizing, clean tooltips, and proper axis labels.
